# ItemUpgradeQualityIcons


<p>I found the upgrade system names to not be very great at expressing the rank they are. Much of the time, this led to gear-hoarding in my bags because I was never certain which items to discard or keep.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>What this addon aims to resolve is to better express these ranks using the profession quality icons.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Rank / Quality:</p>
<p>Explorer - Single Copper Dot</p>
<p>Adventurer - Double Silver Dot</p>
<p>Veteran - Triple Gold Dot</p>
<p>Champion - Quadruple Teal Dot</p>
<p>Hero - Pentagold</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>TODO:</p>
<p>Shift Modifier to tell item level range, ie on "item level" line: Item Level 437 (428-441)</p>
