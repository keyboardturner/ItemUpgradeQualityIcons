# ItemUpgradeQualityIcons


<p>I found the upgrade system names to not be very great at expressing the rank they are. Much of the time, this led to gear-hoarding in my bags because I was never certain which items to discard or keep.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>What this addon aims to resolve is to better express these ranks using the profession quality icons.</p>
<p>In Patch 10.1, gear has upgrade levels. For example, a piece of gear will show "Upgrade Level: Champion 4/8". This addon would supplement that, adding the icons used by profession crafting quality to instead show "Upgrade Level:&nbsp;<img src="https://wow.zamimg.com/uploads/screenshots/normal/1067034.png" alt="" width="20" height="21" />&nbsp;<span style="font-size: 1.2rem;">Champion 4/8". Below is&nbsp; chart of each upgrade level / icon that would display.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Rank / Quality:</p>
<p>Explorer - Single Copper Dot&nbsp;<img src="https://wow.zamimg.com/uploads/screenshots/normal/1067031.png" alt="" width="20" height="20" /></p>
<p>Adventurer - Double Silver Dot&nbsp;<img src="https://wow.zamimg.com/uploads/screenshots/normal/1067032.png" alt="" width="20" height="11" /></p>
<p>Veteran - Triple Gold Dot&nbsp;<img src="https://wow.zamimg.com/uploads/screenshots/normal/1067033.png" alt="" width="20" height="16" /></p>
<p>Champion - Quadruple Teal Dot&nbsp;<img src="https://wow.zamimg.com/uploads/screenshots/normal/1067034.png" alt="" width="20" height="21" /></p>
<p>Hero - Pentagold&nbsp;<img src="https://wow.zamimg.com/uploads/screenshots/normal/1067035.png" alt="" width="20" height="19" /></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>TODO:</p>
<p>Shift Modifier to tell item level range, ie on "item level" line: Item Level 437 (428-441)</p>
